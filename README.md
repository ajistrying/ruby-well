# RubyWell üíé

**A comprehensive Ruby content aggregator that brings together the best of the Ruby community in one searchable place.**

RubyWell aims to be the definitive source for discovering Ruby and Rails content from across the web. By aggregating blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and community resources, we create a centralized hub where developers can find exactly what they're looking for in the Ruby ecosystem.

## üéØ Mission

The Ruby community produces incredible content every day - from in-depth technical blogs and engineering insights to educational podcasts and community newsletters. But this content is scattered across hundreds of individual sites, making it hard to discover and stay current with.

RubyWell solves this by:

- **Aggregating** content from 400+ Ruby blogs, podcasts, and newsletters
- **Organizing** everything by source type (personal blogs, company engineering blogs, podcasts, newsletters)  
- **Providing** intelligent search and filtering to find exactly what you need
- **Staying current** with automatic feed monitoring and content updates

## ‚ú® What's Inside

### üåä Content Sources

- **Personal Blogs** (288 sources) - Individual Ruby developers sharing their insights
- **Company Blogs** (76 sources) - Engineering teams from Ruby-powered companies
- **Community Resources** (38 sources) - Ruby community sites and collaborative blogs
- **Newsletters** (14 sources) - Curated Ruby content delivered regularly
- **Podcasts** (5 sources) - Audio content from Ruby thought leaders

### üì° Smart Aggregation

RubyWell uses intelligent parsing to handle the diverse landscape of web feeds:

- **RSS/Atom Feeds** - Standard blog feeds and podcast feeds
- **JSON Feeds** - Modern JSON-based content syndication
- **WordPress APIs** - Direct integration with WordPress sites
- **Sitemap Parsing** - Fallback for sites without traditional feeds

### üîç Content Discovery

*(Coming Soon)*
- **Full-text search** across all aggregated content
- **Tag-based filtering** for topics like Rails, testing, deployment
- **Category browsing** by content type and source
- **Trending content** based on community engagement
- **Personalized recommendations** based on reading history

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.3+
- Rails 8.0+
- Redis (for Sidekiq)
- Node.js (for asset compilation)

### Installation

```bash

rake feeds:setup

# Start the application
rails server

# Start background job processing
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### Feed Management

```bash
# Check aggregation status
rake feeds:stats

# Fetch latest content
rake feeds:fetch_all

# Add new feeds from OPML
rake feeds:import_opml[path/to/feeds.opml]

# Monitor for issues
rake feeds:errors
```

## üìä Current Stats

- **421 Active Feeds** across all categories
- **Intelligent Parsing** handles 92% of feeds automatically
- **Background Processing** for scalable content fetching
- **Duplicate Prevention** ensures clean, unique content
- **Error Recovery** with automatic retry and fallback strategies

## üîß Architecture

RubyWell is built with a clean, modular architecture:

- **Interactors** handle business logic (OPML import, feed parsing, entry creation)
- **Service Objects** provide specialized parsing for different feed formats
- **Background Jobs** manage scalable, respectful content fetching
- **Models** maintain data integrity with proper validation and relationships
